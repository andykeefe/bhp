_Serpent-Halo_ by Odilon Redon, 1890

Black Hat Python
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This folder contains exercises from Black Hat Python by Justin Seitz and Tim Arnold. A fun book for learning
some pretty cool stuff. 

I began working on this book before I really had a strong foundation in Python, networking, and security,
so I tried to comment a lot and work through each program line by line. About two years later, I plan to go back soon
and finish the rest of the exercises, hopefully with some renewed understanding and greater educational value.
